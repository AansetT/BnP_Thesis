This repository is the implementation of the Branch-and-Price and Column Generation algorithms. It also includes the data used for the computational experiments.
It is implemented for the Multi-Vehicle Cyclic Inventory Routing Problem.

The Jupyter notebooks are used to execute these algorithms. Other scripts can be found in this folder but these can be considered as support for the main scripts.
